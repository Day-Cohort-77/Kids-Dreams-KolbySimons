# Events and Debugging Assessment

Time to assess how well you have learned to use the debugging tools in Chrome Dev Tools, and writing click event listeners. This application is to show kids with illnesses and the memories the would like to make. Celebrities sign up to help kids make memories.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Event Listeners to Create

1. When the kid name is clicked, it should display their wish.
1. When the celebrity name is clicked, it should display their sport.
1. The pairings list should should contain the pairing in the following format.
   ```html
   {child name} will be making memories with {celebrity name}, a {celebrity
   sport} star, by {child wish}
   ```

Below is an animation showing how the application should look when complete and how the event listeners should work.

## Setup

Your instruction team will provide a link for you to create your assessment repository. Once your repo is created, clone it to your machine.

1. Make sure you are in your `workspace` directory.
1. `git clone {github repo SSH string}`.
1. `cd` into the directory it creates.
1. `code .` to open the project code.
1. Use the `serve` command to start the web server.
1. Open the URL provided in Chrome.

Make sure your Developer Tools are open at all times while working on this project. Use the messages provided in the Console to determine what code needs to be fixed or implemented, and use breakpoints in the Sources tab to step through your code as you debug.

## Vocabulary and Understanding

Before you click the "Complete Assessment" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below each question and make a commit.

1. When a child is clicked on in the browser, which module contains the code that will execute on that event happening? Can you explain the algorithm of that logic?

   > The `Kids.js` module is responsible for handling an event listener for when a child's name is clicked.
   > -Setup a click listener.
   > -Create an if statement that checks if the event target has the dataset type === "child".
   > -If true show an alert in the browser using the targeted dataset attributes (name , wish).

2. In the **Pairings** module, why must the `findCelebrityMatch()` function be invoked inside the `for..of` loop that iterates the kids array?

   > It must be invoked inside the `for of` because of the one to one relationship between `children` and `celebrities`. By calling it inside of the loop, every iteration of the kids array will match one child to one celebrity.

3. In the **CelebrityList** module, can you describe how the name of the sport that the celebrity plays can be displayed in the window alert text?

   > By using `${clickEvent.target.dataset.sport}` I am specifically targeting the dataset attribute that has been assigned the value of `celebrity.sport` in the html element being generated by the function `Celebrities`, only if the clickEvent target dataset type is === "celebrity".

4. Can you describe, in detail, the algorithm that is in the `main` module?
   > -Import Pairings, Celebrities, and Kids functions that generate HTML.
   > -Find the DOM element for where the application html will go
   > -Create the HTML structure
   > -Invoke functions in the html structure that will generate html strings
   > -Render it to the DOM
